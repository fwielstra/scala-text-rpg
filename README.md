Just some sunday afternoon screwing around. An outline for a text-based game, uses Scala Streams as a data structure for linking rooms together ([thanks SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8962044/how-do-i-refer-to-a-variable-while-assigning-a-value-to-it-whilst-retaining-imm/8962972#8962972), a fast text formatter with ANSI color coded output ([copied from here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6110062/simple-string-template-replacement-in-scala-and-clojure)), and a relatively simple means of defining a room - may play around with that later.

Todo:
 * Find a way to load / dynamically compile & execute or parse Scala code for arbitrary levels / games
 * Make the syntax for defining a room and linking them together idiot-proof, perhaps with a DSL of sorts
 * Add interactive objects, NPC's
 * Make it an online multiplayer game. Just because. Big hairy goal.
